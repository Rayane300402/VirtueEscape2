                  <h1>Seongsan Ilchulbong,</h1>
                  <p >Also known as Sunrise Peak, the volcanic crater of Seongsan Ilchulbong is Jeju’s most famous and iconic attraction. Wherever you go on the island, you’ll see photos and tour operators advertising trips to go and see it. <br>

                    Formed some five thousand years ago by a volcanic eruption, its distinctive bowl-like shape rises dramatically up above the sea and the waves that pound its steep cliffs. <br>
                    
                    It takes around half an hour to hike the 180 meters to its summit. From its ridge, you can enjoy breathtaking views out over the ocean, Udo Island, and Jeju itself. As its nickname may indicate, a particularly great time of day to visit is at sunrise, when you can witness the sun slowly inch its way above the horizon, lighting up the waters before you. <br>
                    
                    Not to be missed out on, Seongsan Ilchulbong and its unique landscape are the most impressive sights you can expect to see in Jeju Island

                    <h1>Hallasan National Park,</h1>
                    <p >Centered around Hallasan, the highest peak in the country, the national park of the same name will delight nature lovers and outdoor aficionados in equal measure. Towering to a height of 1,950 meters, Hallasan lies right at the heart of Jeju itself, and the dormant volcano’s lofty peak can be seen from almost everywhere on the island. <br>

                        Snaking their way up the side of the mountain are many different trails and paths for you to hike along. Each of them offers astounding views of the surrounding countryside down below. <br>
                        
                        Believed by locals to be inhabited by spirits and gods, Hallasan actually boasts some very distinct fauna and flora due to it having been separated from the mainland for so many millennia. With flower-filled meadows and lush forests found within its confines, the park has lots of beautiful scenery for you to revel in; Baengnokdam crater lake is just one of its many highlights.</p>

                    <p>Lying just half an hour to the east of Jeju City, Hamdeok Beach’s soft sands and shallow waters make it a popular place to visit with families, especially during the warm summer months. <br>

                        While much of the beach disappears at high tide, when the waters retreat, a huge sand bar emerges. This is delightful to stroll along, with the glimmering turquoise waters lying all around you. <br>
                        
                        Bordered by rocky islets and rolling hills with the town of Jocheon lying behind it, the beach is set amid some wonderful scenery, and there are some lovely coastal hikes you can do nearby. In addition to the changing rooms and deckchairs you can find along its golden sands, there are also lots of restaurants, cafes, and hotels for you to choose from. <br>
                        
                        From Hamdeok Beach, the Korea Strait has lots of fantastic watersports, such as kayaking, snorkeling, and water skiing for visitors to enjoy, while paddling in its waters or swimming in the sea is always delightful</p>

                 <h1>Manjanggul Cave,</h1>
                 <p>
                    Formed hundreds of thousands of years ago, Manjanggul Cave is one of the largest and longest lava tube caves in the world and is a very popular draw among tourists. Measuring up to 30 meters high and 23 meters wide, the cave stretches for a staggering nine kilometers. <br>

                    It is these dimensions that make walking along the one kilometer of the enormous cave that is open to the public so impressive. On the way, you’ll pass lots of beautiful stalagmites, stalactites, and rock formations. <br>

                    Besides simply enjoying being in such a unique place, the main attraction is the gigantic 7.8-meter-high lava column that lies at one end of it – the tallest such structure in the world. With bats flitting about here and there and softly-lit lava creations wherever you look, exploring Manjanggul Cave certainly makes for a memorable experience.

                    Offering up the perfect mix of culture and nature, Hallim Park has something for everyone in the family to enjoy; there is even a children’s amusement park for young ones to get a thrill out of. Covering a vast area in the northwest of the island, Hallim Park has lots of delightful gardens for you to wander around, and each of them has a different theme or look with various types of fauna and flora on show. <br>

                    Tucked away amongst its bonsai, water, and palm tree gardens are a small zoo, a charming little restaurant, and a traditional folk village where you can learn more about Jeju’s local culture and customs. On top of all of this, its two main attractions are the enthralling caves of Ssangyonggul and Hyeopjaegul, which you can venture inside to take a look at.

                 <h1>Jeongbang Waterfall,</h1>
                 <p>
                    Lying on the outskirts of Seogwipo, Jeongbang is one of the most famous waterfalls on the island, and with good reason. Shooting off the top of a cliff, Jeongbang’s white waters plunge directly into the ocean below. It is remarkably the only waterfall to do so in the whole of Asia. <br>

                    Towering to a height of 23 meters, the majestic falls certainly make for a dashing sight, as rugged rocks and tree-topped cliffs lie to either side of it. There aren’t many other waterfalls like it in the world. <br>
                    
                    To get up close to Jeongbang, visitors need to clamber over a series of boulders and loose stones. As these can get quite slippery with the waterfall’s spray, it is a good idea to wear comfortable shoes.

                 <h1>Dongmun Market,</h1>
                 <p>
                    Established all the way back in 1945, Dongmun Market’s many shops and stands sell everything under the sun, with glistening fresh fish displays lying next to stalls laden with fruits, vegetables, meat, and more. <br>

                    As vendors also sell clothes, stationery, and souvenirs, it is just as popular with tourists as it is with locals, and wandering around is a fun way to spend an afternoon or evening. <br>

                    There is loads of delicious local food to be had in the market. As dusk falls, people head here to enjoy its fabulous street food, with dumplings and seafood being particularly popular. As it is a traditional market, Dongmun is a great place to visit if you want to get a taste for local life in Jeju City.
