             <h1>Old Medina,</h1>
             <p>
                The old medina is something that cannot be missed from any list of things to do in a Moroccan town or city. <br>
                It is by far the best place to get traditional Moroccan souvenirs, and really experience the heart of the city. <br>
                Here you can haggle for the best prices and take in the sights, sounds and scents.<br>
                 Thankfully, Rabat is a much calmer and easy going city in comparison to cities such as Marrakech and Casablanca. <br>
                 This makes the old medina less chaotic and slightly more accessible. It allows visitors to experience the true Morocco in a more relaxed fashion, with wider streets and a less bustling environment.

              <h1>Ancient Kasbah des Oudaias,</h1>
              <p>
                Built upon a cliff overlooking both the Atlantic Ocean and the Bou Regreg River,<br>
                 the Kasbah des Oudaias is the original site of the city of Rabat.<br>
                Exploring the city by foot requires entering through the massive ornate gates that mark the city’s entrance, <br>
                and it is the only way to experience the small wonders that dot the streets, including gorgeous hand-painted doors and pottery set out on display.<br>
                
                Throughout the narrow streets, Gnawa musicians play their instruments, adding to the enchanting atmosphere that hangs heavy within the walls.

              <h1>Royal Palace of Rabat,</h1>
              <p>Located between the Quartier des Orangers and Agdal-Ryad neighborhoods, the Royal Palace of Rabat is the palatial residence of Morocco’s Royal Family.<br>
                 Also called the Dar al-Makhzen, the palace is heavily guarded, particularly near the enormous and ornately decorated door leading into the palace grounds.<br>

                While visitors are not permitted inside of the palace, the beautiful gate provides an excellent photo opportunity.<br>
                 Guests can also hire a guide or join a city tour to learn more about the history and politics of Morocco

              <h1> Andalusian Gardens,</h1>
              <p>
                Nestled at the entrance of the Kasbah des Oudaias, the Andalusian Gardens offer a tranquil retreat from the surrounding bustle of the city.<br>
                 During Morocco’s colonial period, the French designed and laid out the picturesque grounds with fruit trees, flowers, and exotic flora.<br>

                Inside the walled garden, visitors will find a small cafe that offers mint tea and light snacks with beautiful views of the sea.<br>
                 The vast areas of shade created by the mature trees make this a perfect place to cool off on a hot day while still enjoying the outdoors.
