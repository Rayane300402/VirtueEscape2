              <h1>Cathedral of Christ the Saviour,</h1>
              <p>
                One of Russia’s most visited cathedrals, the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour is a truly remarkable site.<br>
                The grandiose cathedral was built in the 1990s where a 19th-century church of the same name once stood, prior to being demolished in 1931 by the Soviet authorities.<br>
                 For 50 years the place had been home to the world’s largest outdoor swimming pool, until the country’s new government decided to rebuild the sacred place.<br>
                  Designed to look like its predecessor, the modern building also contains the icon Christ Not Painted by Hand by Sorokin,<br>
                   which miraculously survived the demolition of the original cathedral.
