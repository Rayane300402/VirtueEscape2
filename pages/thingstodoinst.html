              <h1> State Hermitage Museum,</h1>
               <p>
                Founded when Empress Catherine the Great started acquiring works of art in the late 1700s,<br>
                 the museum didn't officially open to the public until 1852. <br>
                 Today, the Hermitage is the second-largest art museum in the world after the Louvre,<br>
                 and it's home to a collection of over three million items. <br>
                 The museum also holds an impressive collection of Russian art from the 11th to 19th centuries,<br>
                  a sizable 19th-century Egyptian antiquity collection, and a hall showcasing prehistoric art.<br>
                   The Hermitage has the largest collection of paintings in the world, spanning many countries and centuries. </p>

             <h1> Palace Square,</h1>
             <p>St. Petersburg's main city square is a massive open public space right in front of the Winter Palace.<br>
                 The Alexander Column, built in the 1830s of a single piece of red granite, stands 47 meters tall at the center of the square.<br>
                  It was commissioned by Alexander I to commemorate the victory against Napoleon.<br>

                Many major events in Soviet/Russian history have taken place right on the square-Tsar Alexander II was shot here in 1879, <br>
                and Bolshevik troops started the Revolution here in 1917 by storming the Winter Palace, where the royalty lived.<br>
                 Since then, the square has also been used for marches and demonstrations, from military parades to celebrate Victory Day to New Year's Eve celebrations. </p>

              <h1>Vasilyevsky Island,</h1>
              <p>
                Located just across the river from the city center and the Winter Palace and connected to the mainland by two bridges and a metro line,<br>
                 this small island is home to a number of landmarks and beautiful parks-including a Museum of Electrical Transport; the Peter the Great Museum of Anthropology and Ethnography;<br>
                  the Old Saint Petersburg Stock Exchange; and the Baroque Menshikov Palace, which serves as a branch of the Heritage Museum and holds mainly 17th-century Russian art.<br>

                The Russian Academy of Sciences has several branches on the island, as well-and visitors might particularly appreciate visiting the Institute of Russian Literature, <br>
                which holds original manuscripts of some of Russian's most famous writers, including beloved poet Alexander Pushkin.

            <h1>Church of the Savior on Spilled Blood,</h1>
            <p>
                One of the most beautiful sights in St. Petersburg is this multicolored church designed in traditional medieval Russian style.<br>
                 Alexander III ordered its construction in 1883 on the site where his father had been assassinated two years prior.<br>

                It took over 20 years for the church to be finally completed, partly because of budget and partly because the materials needed for<br>
                 its interior d√©cor (which included 7,500 square meters of mosaics to cover the walls and ceilings)
                weren't that easy to come by.
                
                The church was seriously damaged during the Russian Revolution in 1917, then used as a morgue during WWII and as a potato warehouse right after. <br>
                It took almost 30 years of restoration to get the building to its original splendor-but rather than reopening as a church, the structure is now a museum of mosaics.
