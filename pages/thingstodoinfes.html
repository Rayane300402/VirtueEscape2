             <h1>Medina Of Fez,</h1>
             <p>
                What is believed to be the largest pedestrian zone in the world is an indecipherable maze of more than 9,000 mostly nameless alleys.<br>

                This is held by many as the greatest walled city in the Arab world, where the intertwining streets are so dark and narrow that you can’t even see them from the lookouts atop the valley.<br>
                
                No map can make sense of this place, and you’re sure to get lost, but that’s part of the fun.<br>
                
                When people talk about the Medina, they normally mean both Old Fez (Fes el-Bali) and the newer Fes el-Jdid, founded in the 13th century during the Marinid Dynasty.<br>
                
                It was in this period that Fez reached its cultural peak, becoming a capital and giving rise to madrasas, mosques and some of the city defences that stand today.

              <h1>Bou Inania Madrasa,</h1>
              <p>Founded in the middle of the 14th century by the Marinid ruler Abu Inan Faris, the Bou Inania Madrasa is a feast for the eyes, with every inch of the courtyard filled with exquisite craftsmanship.<br>

                This is also the only religious school in Fez to have its own minaret, also a work of art and hailed as the finest in the city.<br>
                
                The ablution fountain in the courtyard continues to flow after more than 750 years, and standing here it’s hard not to be dumbfounded by the geometrical tilework topped with bands of Arabic calligraphy,<br>
                 the feather-light stuccowork, and the carved cedar screens.<br>
                
                The skill and man-hours in this space boggles the mind.  </p>

              <h1>Jardin Jnan Sbil,</h1>
              <p>Between Fes el-Jdid and Fes el-Bali is the oldest park in the city, landscaped in the 18th century on the orders of Sultan Moulay Abdallah.<br>

                A rare patch of green space where you can flee the crowds in the Medina for a few minutes, Jardin Jnan Sbil was allowed to fall into decline until the 2000s when it was replanted.<br>
                
                Now meticulously tended, the park has a large pond and water gardens where geometric fountains are festooned with zellige tiles, all bordered by geometric beds of roses, cactuses and low boxwood hedges.<br>
                
                For shade there are palms, orange trees, pines and an avenue of skyscraping cypresses. </p>

              <h1> Funduq al-Najjariyyin,</h1>
              <p>
                To the side is a 19th-century saqayya, a fountain for caravans, with astonishing zellige tiles and honeycomb plasterwork.<br>

                The Funduq, commissioned by the Alaouite Sultan Ismail Ibn Sharif, is preserved as a museum for woodwork.<br>
                
                You can go in to look up at the three storeys of galleries, and peruse a showcase of artful wood-carving from the city’s past.<br>
                
                On display are furniture, doors, musical instruments, canopies and other architectural elements, as well as traditional woodworking tools.<br>
                
                There’s a cafe on the roof, for a glass of mint tea high above the chaos of the Medina. </p>

              <h1> Chouara Tannery,</h1>
              <p>Here sheepskin, goatskin and cow and camel hides are cured and cleaned in a pungent mix of cow urine, pigeon droppings, salt, quicklime and water.<br>

                Once soft they are then soaked in big colourful earthen pits to be dyed.<br>
                
                Traditionally these would contain turmeric (yellow), indigo (blue), mint (green), henna (orange) and crushed poppy (red), although chemical dyes tend to be used today.<br>
                
                This part of the process is mesmerising, and the vats look like a giant painter’s palette from the terraces above.
