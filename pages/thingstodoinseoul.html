                  <h1>The Seoul Tower,</h1>
                  <p >Rising almost 500 meters above the city, this communications and observation tower provides dramatic views of the city from its perch on the side of Mount Namsan. A cable car whisks you up the side of the mountain to the base of the tower. From here, you can go up in the tower and visit any one of four observation decks, one of which is a rotating restaurant. <br>

                    There are two restaurants at the tower and, of course, several gift shops. There's even a digital observatory, where people with height issues can experience a live, 360-degree view through the use of 32 LED screens and cameras mounted at the tower's top. <br>
                    
                    The views from the tower are great, but so are the views of the tower from most parts of the city. Computer-controlled LED lighting on the exterior of the tower provides a digital, visual cultural experience of Seoul with themed lighting presentations.

                    <h1> National Museum of Korea,</h1>
                    
                    <p>This must-see attraction in Seoul showcases the incredible history and artwork of Korea and the Korean people. The museum, one of the largest in Asia, is in the city's Yongsan District (close to Itaewon). It focuses on archeology, history, and art and includes a vast collection of works and objects going back more than a million years. There are ancient and prehistoric artifacts, sculpture, paintings, and other artwork along with a large collection of objects and antiques. <br>

                        Before or after your museum visit, head down the street to Yongsan Family Park, a nice outdoor space to relax. Another important museum, The War Memorial of Korea, is also close by.</p>

                 <h1>Gyeongbokgung Palace,</h1>
                 <p>
                    First built in 1395, Gyeongbokgung Palace is the largest of Seoul's five grand palaces built during the powerful Joseon dynasty. Destroyed and rebuilt several times over the centuries, it was restored to its original glory after the Second World War and totally restored in the 1990s. <br>

                    Within the palace grounds, you can also find the National Palace Museum of Korea and the National Folk Museum, and both are worth a visit. The palace museum is especially fascinating as it presents items from the palaces of the Joseon Dynasty. This includes priceless antiques and artwork, as well as everyday items for cooking, cleaning, and daily life. The National Folk Museum focuses on items from daily life, as well as clothing and dioramas, to tell the story of the Korean people since prehistoric times.

                  <h1>Gwanghwamun Gate,</h1>
                  <p>The largest and main gate to Seoul's Gyeongbokgung Palace, Gwanghwamun Gate is home to the changing of the guards ceremony (performed since 1469), which happens daily (except Tuesdays) at 10am and 2pm. The gate has undergone many renovations and rebuilding, most recently in 2010, when it was restored to its original location and reconstructed with native materials. <br>

                    There's a large plaza in front, and the gate sits in front of the vast Gwanghwamun Square, home to frequent political demonstrations, a large subway station, giant fountain, and some huge statues of Joseon-era leaders..

                  <h1>Jingwansa Temple, Bukhansan National Park,</h1>
                  <p >Set within the strikingly beautiful landscape of the Bukhansan National Park, Jingwansa is an ancient temple complex offering many ways to experience and learn about Buddhism. The traditional buildings are surrounded by miles of hiking trails (you can come here just to hike) snaking through the mountains. <br>

                    The temple, which grows most of its own food (and ferments its own kimchee), has a range of public programs. There's a temple stay program, which includes an overnight visit, plus there are cultural and learning programs. They also offer foodie experiences like a traditional vegetarian temple meal, as eaten by the monks. Jingwansa is on the far west side of the city, one of the four major temples of Seoul first built around 1,000 BC.

                  <h1>Itaewon,</h1>
                  <p >Itaewon is a bustling neighborhood of Seoul focused on a few pedestrian streets filled with shops, caf√©s, and other consumer businesses. If you have limited time in the city, it's one of the those places that can give you a real feel for Korean retail culture in a short time period. There are food carts, street performers, and some of the side streets are filled with restaurants. <br>

                    This is an excellent place to wander around and just lose yourself in the energy of the city. Be sure to wander down Gyeongnidan Street, as it's lined with all kinds of restaurants and is a place to buy many international foods not easily available in Korea (like pizza and American-style barbecue). Another street is filled with antique shops, and this is always an excellent place to buy gifts.
