             <h1>Bahia Palace,</h1>
             <p>
               This 150-room palace was home to slave-turned-vizier Abu ‘Bou’ Ahmed, who spared no expense in its gorgeous decoration.<br>
                The painted, gilded ceilings, polychrome zellige tiling and carved stucco still have the intended effect – which is just ‘wow’.<br>
                Bahia is roughly translated as ‘beautiful’ and that’s definitely not an overstatement. <br>
                Escape from the heat of the midday sun to the palace’s shaded spaces and get lost in all the intricate detailing.

              <h1>Souk Semmarine,</h1>
              <p>
                Marrakech is famous for its souks (markets) and Souk Semmarine is the biggest of them all.<br>
                 Rugs, leather goods, silverware and crockery of all shapes and sizes are on offer in this labyrinth – just try not to get lost.<br>

                Why go? If you’re looking for a true Marrakchi experience, get stuck in and do some haggling with one of the local traders.<br>
                 Knock them down from their opening price and come away with a one-of-a-kind memento.

              <h1>Souk Place des Épices,</h1>
              <p>
                What is it? Moroccan cuisine is famous for its rich, aromatic flavours. <br>
                Place des Épices is the traditional spice souk where you’ll find merchants selling everything from allspice to ras al hanout (a mix of more than a dozen spices).<br>
                Why go? This open-air souk is truly atmospheric. As well as bags of spices,<br>
                you can pick up colourful basketry or simply watch the show from one of the cafés that ring the square.

              <h1> Musée des Confluences,</h1>
              <p>
               The former governor’s palace and home to the notorious Thami El Glaoui, Lord of the Atlas.<br>
                Now the Musée des Confluences, it houses the archaeological collection of American Patty Birch and puts on shows exploring the intersection of eastern and western cultures.<br>

                Why go? This is probably the most beautiful construction in the medina,<br>
                 vast in ambition and covered in intricate detail: coffered cedar ceilings, geometric tiling, stucco worked into elaborate floral motifs.<br>
                 Don’t miss Marrakech’s best coffee shop, Bacha Coffee House, which serves more than 40 brews in the same building. </p>

              <h1> The Mellah,</h1>
              <p>What is it? The Jewish quarter of Marrakech,<br>
                 which has undergone an extensive renovation programme. <br>
                 Make sure to visit the Al Azama synagogue and the extraordinary Miara cemetery.<br>

                Why go? Tours give an insight into a fascinating part of Marrakech’s (and Morocco’s) history. <br>
                This area of the city is rarely explored by tourists other than Jewish heritage groups – get down before everyone else cottons on.</p>
