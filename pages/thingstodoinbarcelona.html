              <h1> Las Ramblas,</h1>
               <p>
                Never mind that a lot of locals shun this sequence of promenades that runs from Plaça de Catalunya down to the Columbus Monument at the waterfront.<br>

                If you’re a tourist it’s one of those things that you have to do.<br>
                
                In summer you’ll be under the shade of the tall plane trees and shuffling through the crowds that pass living statues,<br>
                street performers, bird-sellers and flower stands.<br>
                
                Occasionally you’ll catch the whiff of waffles (gofres) being baked.<br>
                
                Once you get to the water you can keep going along the boards to visit the Maremagnum mall or Barcelona’s Aquarium.

             <h1> Sagrada Família,</h1>
             <p>
                This is where to begin your adventure through Barcelona and the dreamlike works of Antoni Gaudí.<br>

                His minor basilica is a project of incredible scale and ambition that is still only around three quarters complete more than a 140 years after Gaudí first became involved.<br>
                
                When its spires are finished it will be the tallest church building in the world, and hardly resembles any religious structure you’ll have seen in your life.<br>
                
                The Sagrada Família combines several architectural styles including Catalan Modernism, Art Nouveau and Spanish Late-Gothic, but Gaudí’s masterpiece defies these kinds of definitions when you look up open-mouthed at the ceiling of the nave.

              <h1> Montjuïc,</h1>
              <p>
                This city district was developed for the 1929 International Exhibition and features several high-profile museums including the National Museum of Catalan Art, the Museum of Archaeology and the Ethnology Museum.<br>

                Of those the art museum is particularly recommended, and the views of the city from its steps are stunning.<br>
                
                Below this, and also built for the exhibition was the Magic Fountain, which puts on light and music shows ever half-hour on the weekends. This is best seen at night of course.<br>
                
                At the very top of the hill is the 17th-century fortress, which saw action in the Catalan Revolt in the 1600s as well as during the Civil War in the late-1930s, after which it was a prison.  </p>

            <h1>Palau de la Música Catalana,</h1>
            <p>
                This turn-of-the-century concert hall is yet another piece of Barcelona’s UNESCO-listed heritage.<br>

                It was built by Gaudí’s contemporary, Lluís Domènech i Montaner for the Orfeó Català, a Barcelona choral society.<br>
                
                This was at a time when investment and commissions by wealthy Catalan industrialists were helping a generation of artists and designers to create a new sense of Catalan identity.<br>
                
                The hall is a sublime venue for opera, symphonies and folk music, so have a look at the schedule when you plan your trip .<br>

              <h1> Plaça de Catalunya,</h1>
              <p>
                This is the best meeting point in the city. It’s right at the bottom of the posh Passeig de Gràcia and at the top of Las Ramblas.<br>

                If you’re waiting for friends in the evening for a meal or getting ready for a shopping expedition by day nowhere in the Ciutat Vella or Eixample will be more than a few minutes on foot from this grand square.<br>
                
                Barcelona’s flagship branch of El Corte Inglés is right here, and if you’re new to the city and want to get oriented you could go inside to pick up a map.
