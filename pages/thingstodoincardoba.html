              <h1>La Mezquita (The Great Mosque),</h1>
               <p>
                La Mezquita is the Great Mosque that was created for the Caliphate of Córdoba,<br>
                 an important Moorish kingdom of Andalusia. Built in the eighth century, the UNESCO-listed Mezquita<br>
                  is a masterpiece of Islamic architecture and is considered one of the most striking monuments of Moorish Spain.<br>
                  The mosque was converted to a cathedral in 1523 by the Catholic Monarchs.<br>
                   The cathedral's sanctuary, with its Gothic choir, was plopped right in the center of the mosque,
                    while keeping the basic framework of the Islamic architecture. <br>
                    The mosque-to-cathedral conversion makes for an incongruous sense of design but serves as a reminder of Córdoba's multicultural heritage.

             <h1> Judería (Old Jewish Quarter),</h1>
             <p>
                The old Jewish quarter is one of the most delightful areas of Córdoba to explore. With its narrow lanes,<br>
                 whitewashed houses, flower-filled patios, and quiet little squares, this area has a very distinctive atmosphere.<br>

                Besides the enchanting Andalusian ambience, highlights of this historic neighborhood include two important Jewish monuments: the 15th-century Mudéjar-style synagogue at the center of the quarter,<br>
                 and the Casa de Sefarad (House of Spanish Jews) museum; both sights are on the Calle Judíos.<br>
                 The Casa de Sefarad has been restored to its 14th-century glory and features five themed rooms that illustrate the history and culture of the Sephardi (Spanish Jews).

                The Palacio de Viana is an aristocratic palace that dates back to the 15th century. <br>

                 Visitors have a chance to admire an exceptional assortment of paintings, antique furniture, <br>
                 and tapestries.
               The grounds include 12 patios designed in the Andalusian style with decorative fountains and lush landscaping. <br>
               Each patio reveals a unique style, from the 16th-century reception courtyard with porticoed galleries to a courtyard filled with fragrant orange trees.

              Within the lavish grounds are fountains, formal parterres, pebbled paths, and elegant arcades. <br>
              Lovely date palms, vibrant bougainvillea, and sweet jasmine are planted throughout the garden.

            <h1>Museo de Bellas Artes,</h1>
            <p>
                Córdoba's Museum of Fine Arts is housed in the former Hospital de la Caridad de Nuestro Señor Jesucristo, <br>
                a 15th-century hospital that belonged to a Catholic monastery. <br>
                The museum has an excellent collection of Spanish paintings from the 15th to the 21st centuries.<br>

                Highlights include the works by Zurbarán, Alejo Fernández, Antonio del Castillo, Valdés Leal, and Julio Romero de Torres.<br>
                 Visitors are also surprised by the interesting assortment of 17th-century, 19th-century, and contemporary sculptures displayed throughout the museum.

              <h1> Iglesia de San Miguel,</h1>
              <p>
                This church belongs to the group of 14 parish churches built after the Reconquest of Córdoba. <br>
                These churches are called Fernandinas, and many were renovations of old mosques.<br>
                 Most of the Fernandinas were built with repurposed materials, which explains why they have Roman and Moorish columns.<br>

            The Church of San Miguel features Romanesque elements as well as Caliphate-era and Mudéjar details. <br>
            The distinctive architectural styles are seen in the baptismal chapel and the Epistle side doorway. <br>
            Some of the arches incorporate Hebrew characters.
