             <h1>The Church on the Blood ,</h1>
             <p>
                Church on the Blood got its name for a reason. Built on the site of Ipatiev’s house,<br>
                 where the last Russian tsar with his family and servants was executed, the church is a reminder of one of the most tragic and bloodiest pages of Russian history.<br>
                 To the right of the Church on the Blood (if you are facing the main entrance) is located patriarchal metochion<br>
                  where the Patriarch of Moscow and all Rus’ stays during his visits to Yekaterinburg. <br>
                  You can visit the Church and the museum complex dedicated to the last months of the royal family’s life inside the metochion.

              <h1>Opera and Ballet Theatre,</h1>
              <p>
            
                Catching a play in a theatre is one best things to do in Yekaterinburg.<br>
                  Opened in 1912, Yekaterinburg State Academic Opera and Ballet Theatre is one of the oldest opera theaters in the country.<br>
                   Book your tickets in advance, arrive to the show a little early to explore the beautiful building,<br>
                    and don’t forget that in Russia “theater starts at the cloakroom” — leave your overcoat with a surprisingly fast babushka before entering the hall.<br> 

                Yekaterinburg boasts a wide range of amazing theaters, unfortunately, <br>
                you need to know Russian to see anything else, but opera and ballet. If you understand Russian,<br>
                 Theatre of Musical Comedy and Kolyada-theatre are some of the most beloved by locals.
