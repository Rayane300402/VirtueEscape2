             <h1> Black Sea,</h1>
             <p>Knowing what to do in Sochi Russia will make you enjoy the best vacation in 2021.<br>
                 Beached in Sochi are its biggest drawcards, without a doubt. There is plenty of space to choose from in the 150 km coastline running along with the city.<br>

                   So, if you want to beat the heat then take a plunge into the black sea in Sochi.
