                    <p>
                        Palma’s vast cathedral ('La Seu' in Catalan) is the city's major architectural landmark. <br>
                        Aside from its sheer scale, treasures and undoubted beauty, its stunning interior features,
                        designed by Antoni Gaudí and renowned contemporary artist Miquel Barceló,<br>
                        make this unlike any cathedral elsewhere in the world. The awesome structure is predominantly
                        Gothic, apart from the main facade,<br>
                        which is startling, quite beautiful and completely mongrel. <br>
                        The stunning rose window is the largest in Europe, see it up close by visiting the roof
                        terraces.

                    <h1>Basílica de Sant Francesc,</h1>
                    <p>
                        One of Palma’s oldest churches, the Franciscan Basílica de Sant Francesc was begun in 1281 in
                        Gothic style,<br>
                        while the baroque facade, with its carved postal and rose window, was completed in 1700. In the
                        splendid Gothic cloister – a two-tiered, <br>
                        trapezoid affair – the elegant columns indicate it was also some time in the making. <br>
                        Inside, the high vaulted roof is classic Gothic, while the glittering high altar is a baroque
                        lollipop, albeit in need of a polish.

                    <p>
                        This house, palatial by any definition, was one of several residences of the phenomenally
                        wealthy March family.<br>
                        nside, more than 20 lithographs by Dalí around the themes 'Alchemy and Eternity' catch the eye,

                        Christmas time, you can watch a short video <br>
                        documenting the painstaking installation of the display into its current home in 2007.<br>

                        Upstairs, the artist Josep Maria Sert (1874–1945) painted the main vault and music room ceiling.

                    <p>
                        The 17th-century Can Gallard del Canya, a 17th-century mansion overlaid with minor Modernist
                        touches, now houses a small but significant collection of painting and sculpture. <br>
                        The permanent exhibits – some 80 pieces held by the Fundación Juan March – constitute a
                        veritable who’s who of contemporary Spanish art, <br>
                        including Miró, Picasso, fellow cubist Juan Gris, Dalí, and the sculptors Eduardo Chillida and
                        Julio González.<br>

                        After starting with the big names, the collection skips through various movements in Spanish
                        art, <br>
                        such as that inspired in Barcelona by the Dau al Set review (1948–53) and led by Antoni Tàpies.

                        Built with flair and innovation into the shell of the Renaissance-era seaward walls, this
                        contemporary art gallery is one of the finest on the island.<br>
                        Its temporary exhibitions are worth viewing, but the permanent collection – works by Miró,
                        Barceló and Picasso – gives the gallery its cachet<br>
                        The 21st-century concrete complex is cleverly built among the fortifications, including the
                        partly restored remains of an 11th-century<br>
                        Muslim-era tower (on your right as you arrive from Carrer de Sant Pere). Inside, the ground
                        floor houses the core of the permanent exhibition, starting with a section on Mallorcan
                        landscapes by local artists <br>
                        and others from abroad; the big names here include the Catalan Modernista artist Santiago
                        Rusiñol.
